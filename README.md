# Bit7Bot

This is my first Python coding experience going back to 2019-2020. 
Used selenium.webdriver + geckodriver for Windows to parse front-end of one of the exchanges that do not provide access to API for order management automation.
ALCM stands for "Anti Liquidation Counter Measure", this functionality is now being added in some exchanges like ByBit and called Auto-Add marging. 
If you are new to trading, this is like to chaff against AA missiles that saves your position.
